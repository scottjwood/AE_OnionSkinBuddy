# Onion Skin Buddy

## After effects script to create make shift onion skins.

**THIS IS NOT TESTED VERY WELL, it works well for a project I need it for. Your mileage may vary, consider yourself warned.**

**Installation**
Install script into ScriptUI folder, a quick google search will help you with this if you don't know how.

**Usage**
Open the Onion Skin Buddy panel via *Window > AE_OnionSkinBuddy*, select layer and choose your options.

Number of skins is how many onion skins before/after you need. 4 will create 4 skins before and 4 after. Opacity is the starting opacity for a skin, opacity gradually decreases for each skin created. Skin every x frames is how many frames to stagger between skins.

Hope this helps someone else!

The idea for this came from a post by Paul Tuersley on www.aenhancers.com.
